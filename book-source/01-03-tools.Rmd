# Local Setup

To make your Shiny applications accessible for a wider audience, you must 
have some tools available locally on your laptop or desktop --- sorry, a 
tablet or a phone are not recommended devices for this.
You will become familiar with several tools used to manage your code
locally or communicate with remote machines.

By the end of this chapter, you should have obtained the knowledge and the 
local setup of tools to connect to a remote server and run a Shiny app from 
the command line.

## Installing Your Developer Tools

### R

R is a programming language designed mainly for statistical computation, but it 
has been extended with packages to support tasks like developing web apps with 
Shiny.

To begin, you must install the appropriate binary for your operating system 
available at <https://cran.r-project.org/> under the "Download and Install R" 
section.

Next, you should install an integrated development environment or IDE of your choice.
One of the most popular ways to develop in R is to use the [RStudio Desktop]()
developed by Posit (formerly RStudio). You can download the binary from
<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

Another increasingly popular IDE option for R is Microsoft's VisualStudio Code, 
or VS Code for short. You can download the installer from 
<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>.
It is recommended to use the R extension for VS Code that relies on the
`languageserver` R package [@R-languageserver].
You can find setup instructions in the 
[REditorSupport/vscode-R](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R) 
GitHub repository.
Another useful extension is the Shiny VS Code extension from the
VS Code Marketplace or the Open VSX Registry.

To install Shiny, you can run the command `install.packages("shiny")` in the 
R console. You will need a few other packages too:

```R
install.packages(c("bslib", "shinylive", "htmltools", "rmarkdown"))
```
FIXME: list other R packages.

### Install Python

As a scripting language, Python is versatile and can be developed in different 
environments including text editors and IDEs. The recommended IDE for developing
in Shiny with Python is VS Code.

To use the IDE for Python, you must ensure that Python can run on your operating 
system. Operating systems like MacOS and Linux should already have come bundled 
with a version of Python, but it may be an older version. Therefore, we recommend 
installing the latest Python version for MacOS and Windows from 
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>. For Linux/Unix based operating systems, 
we recommend installing Python using the command line with the following 
commands: 

Install Shiny with `pip install shiny`. Some of the examples will use Shinylive,
you can install it with `pip install shinylive`.
FIXME: CHECK this, how to install Python and `pip` etc.


The Shiny VS Code extension from the
VS Code Marketplace or the Open VSX Registry works with R and Python as well.
Python itself also has VS Code extensions that can be used.

A rathe new IDE option that R and Python users should keep an eye on is
[Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) by Posit as it promises to be 
an extensible, polyglot tool for writing code and exploring data.

### Web Browser

You likely already have a web browser on your local machine. Most people use
Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox.
Sometimes, as you develop apps and check the results in your browser, you
might run into very obscure errors. In such cases, before searching for
fixes on the Internet, try clearing the browser cache or do a hard refresh.
You might also find it useful to view the apps in incognito mode. This way
it will automatically clear the cache and cookies without affecting your 
regular browser windows.

### Quarto

Quarto is a open-source scientific and technical publishing system by Posit that
can include Shiny apps. You can find install instructions at <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.

### Docker Desktop

To download and install Docker for your platform of choice, visit the
[Docker download page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
follow the instructions.
Note that commercial use of Docker Desktop in larger enterprises 
(more than 250 employees or more than $10 million USD in annual revenue) 
requires a paid subscription.

If you are a Mac OS X user on Apple Silicone (M1 chip and above), you might want 
to enable virtualization to be able to run and build images for AMD64 architecture.
Otherwise the images might have poor performance or fail on other platforms.
Go to the Settings in Docker Desktop, and under the General tab check 
the "Use Virtualization framework" and 
"Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon" boxes.

## The Command Line

The command line is a text-based user interface to control a computer. Instead of
using a mouse, you use your keyboard to type commands to control the computer. This is
different than the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) used in modern day operating systems
like Windows, Mac OSX, and Ubuntu Desktop Linux. The command line is important for
managing your Shiny app deployment on a remote server where there might not be a GUI
for you to control the remote server.

Depending on your operating system, there are different options for the command line.

On Windows, we recommend installing [Windows Subsytem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) 
in order to use a Linux based command line. This is because some commands that 
we describe in this book may be incompatible with Windows based command lines 
like PowerShell (comes preinstalled on Windows) or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

For Mac OS X, we recommend using the built-in terminal application. You will be 
able to run the commands that we describe in the book.

For Linux-based systems like Ubuntu , you can also use the built-in terminal application.

Our book will cover commands using a "*nix based command line". This means the 
Windows Subsytem Linux terminal or the built-in terminals with Mac OS X or Ubuntu.

The terminal is also available from inside your IDE (RStudio or VS Code),
which means that you won't have to change windows to access it.

Now let's review some of the most common shell commands that we'll need in the
absence of a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Navigation

Navigating through the command line might seem daunting at first. 
However, it is quite simple once you memorize 3 key commands involving directories.

#### Current Working Directory

To know which directory you are in, you can type the `pwd` command. This will give
you the path of the "working directory" that you are in.

#### Listing Directory

The `ls` command is used to list all files in a directory.
This is important to know when you are trying to find a file on the command line.

#### Change Directory

The `cd` command is used to change directories and traverse a computer. For 
example, you may want to change your working directory to a nested folder of your 
current working directory. In order to do so, you would type `cd` in the command 
line and typing a space after, and then press `tab` to see the available 
directories to traverse to. With the correct directory in mind, you can type 
the directory name after and press enter to change directories.

To verify that you are in the new directory, your command line should indicate 
the current directory that you are in. If you are still unsure, you can use the 
`pwd` command to get the path of your current working directory.

By running `cd ..` you can go up one directory. To go up 2 directories, you can 
run: `cd ../..`.

### Editing Files

Once you can navigate through the computer with command line. The next important 
task to know about is editing files with a text editor. There are many
popular text editors that usually come bundled with your *nix based command line
including: `nano`, `vim`, and `emacs`. Vim and Emacs are much more complex 
and require more technical knowledge to edit and save files. Therefore, 
if your are just staring out, we recommend using Nano.

Nano is a user-friendly text editor that allows you to edit files from the 
command line. To begin, you can type `nano` followed by a space and the name of 
the file you want to edit, e.g. `nano app.R`. If the name of the file does not 
exist, nano will create the file for you when you save it.

To navigate through a file with Nano, you can use your arrow keys to move the 
cursor. You can add text to the file by typing on your keyboard.

The instructions for nano are at the bottom of the editor. The `^` stands for 
the CTRL key and the letter beside it stands for the key you press to run the 
command. Press the CTRL key together with the letter on the keyboard to execute 
a command.

To save the file, you would press `CTRL + O` and confirm the prompts with enter.
To exit nano, you would press `CTRL + X`.

### File and Directory Operations

It is also important to know about how to move, copy, and delete files and 
directories. Furthermore it is also important to know how to create directories.

#### Making Directories

To make a directory you would type `mkdir` followed by a space and the directory name.
To confirm that the directory is created, you can run the `ls` command and see that
the folder has been created. You can even try to navigate to it with the `cd` command.

#### Moving Files and Directories

To move a file or directory, you would simply type 
`mv <path to file you want to move> <destination path>`.
You can verify that a file or directory has moved with `ls <destination path>` 
and you should see that in its new location.

#### Copying Files and Directories

Copying files is similar to moving files. To copy a file, you would run 
`cp <path to file you want to copy> <destination path and filename>`.

To copy a directory, you will need to add the `-r` flag so that the whole 
directory is copied "recursively". The command you would run would be: 
`cp -r <path to directory you want to copy> <destination path and directory name>`.

You can verify that a file or directory has been copied with 
`ls <destination path>` and you should see that in its new location.

#### Deleting Files and Directories

To delete files run: `rm <path to file you want to delete>`.

For deleting directories, you will need to add the `-r` flag so that the whole 
directory is deleted "recursively". The command to delete directories is: 
`rm -r <path to directory you want to delete>`.

You can verify that a file or directory has been removed with 
`ls <path to old file or directory>`. There should be an error saying that the 
file and directory do not exist.

### Super User Access

At times you may find that you do not have the correct permissions to edit a 
file or even view a directory. Therefore, you must use super user access to gain 
the correct permissions for your current user.

If you are looking for super user permissions for a single command you can run: 
`sudo <command>`. Command in this case can be any command line command including 
the ones we have described earlier in the chapter like `rm`.
For example, you could run `sudo rm test.txt` where we are using super user access 
to delete the test file.

You may also find that you need super user permissions for multiple commands.
In this case you can start a command line as a super user by running `sudo -i` 
and following the prompts. To exit out of the super user command line you can 
press `CTRL + D` or run the command `logout` or `exit`.

## Source Code Management with Git

Source code management is important to keep centralized versions of your Shiny 
application source code. By centralizing your source code, you can have one 
source truth of your application code that can be duplicated anywhere. Source 
code management also helps to save different versions of a file without creating 
multiple copies of a file.

Git is one of the most popular version control systems for software. In this 
section, we will be describing how to get started with Git.

Git comes installed by default on most Mac OS X and Linux machines.
On Windows you can install Git from <https://git-scm.com/download/>.
Try `git version` in the terminal to test if Git is installed properly.

### Git Services

Git services help host your source code remotely. Two of the most popular Git 
services are GitHub and GitLab. Both are good choices and the instructions in 
this section apply to both services. However, we recommend using GitHub as later 
in the book we describe continuous deployment and continuous integration (CICD) 
that relies on GitHub Actions.

### Git Commands

To follow along with the commands, you will first need to sign up for your Git 
service. Following sign up, you should create an empty repository which will 
host your source code.

In this book, we will outline how to use Git from the command line. There are 
also graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for git. However, when connecting remotely 
to a server, a GUI to use the server is unavailable.

We recommend that you set your default Git text editor to nano with this command: 
`git config --global core.editor "nano"`. Often the default editor is set to 
Vim or emacs which is harder to use.

#### Cloning Repositories

Once you have created a repository, you can clone it to your computer. 
To do so, you would run `git clone <repository url>` and enter the appropriate 
credentials. For example, you can clone the GitHub repository with
one of our Shiny app examples, the Old Faithful example as:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h10y/faithful.git
```

If you are cloning a _private_ GitHub repository, you must setup an access token 
to be used as a password for the `git clone` command.
For private GitLab repositories, you would use the same password to be used as 
you would sign in on the website, but you can also create an access token.

#### Creating a Commit

When you have cloned the repository, you can begin adding file changes via a 
commit. To begin, you would add or modify files in the repository directory. 
After you have made changes, you can create a commit using three commands.

First, you would run `git add .` from the root directory of your repository. 
This command stages your changes for the commit. The `.` signifies the current 
directory and all its files and directories in it.

Next, you would run `git commit -m "<message for your commit>"` to create a 
commit with a message. The `-m` flag indicates that you will have a message for 
your commit. You must enclose your message within quotation marks. A commit must 
always have a message.

Finally, once you have created your commit, you can push your changes with 
`git push`.

#### Pulling Changes

You might have multiple copies of your repository on different computers. 
In such cases, to keep the changes of files and directories in sync, you can 
run the `git pull` command.

It should be noted that if you make changes in your repository without 
committing them, you must commit your changes before performing a pull.

If you have committed changes and the repository has been updated elsewhere, 
merge conflicts may arise. To detect which files have conflicts, you can run 
the `git diff --check` command which shows the files and line numbers that 
have conflicts. The conflicts in the files will appear as `<<<<<<< HEAD` at the 
top with the current changes you have under it. This is separated with `=======` 
and the changes that are conflicting under it. The conflicting changes are 
concluded with `>>>>>>> <branch name>`.

You must delete the `<<<<<<< HEAD` and enclosing `>>>>>>> <branch name>`, 
keeping only the change that you want and running `git commit` to resolve any 
conflicts for your repository.

#### Status of Repository

To determine what files you changed and are not tracking, you can run the 
`git status` command. This command will give you the files you have modified and 
files that are not yet tracked by git. This command will also tell you how many 
changes you have locally that haven't been pushed to the git service yet.

### .gitignore

Often there are extraneous files that are artifacts of running your Shiny 
application or contain sensitive information, like passwords or access tokens,
and do not need to be committed. To ignore these files, you can create a 
`.gitignore` file in the root of your repository.

To generate a `.gitignore` file, you can visit [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) 
which will generate a file with the files and directories to ignore for an 
operating system, programming language, or tool. We recommend selecting: 
linux, macOS, windows, R, and Python as a base `.gitignore`.

### Branching

Branching is a more advanced concept in Git that is useful when you have 
multiple people working on the same files. In this subsection, we will briefly 
touch on the basics of git branching.

A branch is a copy of a repository that you can work on and make changes for a 
specific feature. Once that feature has been completed you can merge it back to 
your `main` branch. This allows multiple people to work on the same codebase.

To see the branches that exist in your repository, run the `git branch` command.

To create a branch in your repository, run the `git checkout -b <branch name>` 
command. It should be noted that when you first try to push your new branch 
with `git push`, you will be unsuccessful since the remote repository has no 
idea of the branch. Therefore you must run 
`git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>`. Do not worry if you cannot 
remember this command! Git will give you a reminder of the command to run to 
push a new branch.

To switch branches, run the `git checkout <branch name> command`.
To merge the changes of one branch to your current branch, run the 
`git merge <branch name>` command.

There is an option to review merges on GitHub and GitLab. On GitHub, you would 
open a pull request. On GitLab, you would open a merge request. Both of these 
options are not part of Git itself, but offered by Git services so that code 
development can be more collaborative. A pull request or merge request, allows 
you to preview the merged changes, comment on specific lines of the changes, 
and fix any conflicts before merging.

Often, you can use Git-based workflows to make changes to your Shiny application 
codebase. The GitHub workflow is a lightweight workflow that leverages pull 
requests for collaborative development. Developers create feature branches from 
the main branch, make changes, and then open pull requests to propose these 
changes for review. Once reviewed and approved, the changes are merged into the 
main branch.

## Servers

Your Shiny App deployment is likely going to live on a remote computer that is 
always running, aptly named a "server". In this section, we will be explaining 
how to connect remotely to servers via SSH from the command line.

Servers running remotely often do not contain a graphical user interface, and 
therefore it is recommended to become familiar with the command line.
Once connected, you can run the command line commands explained in the previous 
sections of this chapter.

The commands in the following subsections require the setup of a server. 
We outline how to do so in Part IV. However, you can also just read along to 
familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of using a remote server.

### Secure Shell (SSH)

The secure shell protocol (SSH) is used to securely connect with a remote computer.
The connection works via public key cryptography. This means that a public key 
lives on the server and you have a private key on your local machine. 
The private key on your local machine matches with the public key on the remote 
machine to verify your identity.

There are two common ways to authenticate with SSH: using a password, or using a 
private/public key pair. It is recommended to use the private/public key pair 
method as it is much harder to guess a private key compared to a password. 

#### Password Authentication

To authenticate with a password, you can run this command:
`ssh <user name>@<server ip address>`.

When you authenticate with a password, a private/public key pair is automatically 
generated for you. However, this method is less secure because a password is 
easier to guess compared to a randomly generated key file. 

#### Key-based Authentication

To authenticate with a key file, you can run this command:
`ssh -i <location of key file> <user name>@<server ip address>`.

By running this command, the remote computer can verify that the user logging 
in with the public key that is stored on the remote computer.

We outline how to generate a key in Part IV.

## Readability on the Command Line

Sometimes commands are too long or it would help reading them if we could
put the parts on multiple lines without "hitting Enter" (executing) too early.
This is where the backslash (`\`) comes in. We can use the `\` to write
multi-line commands. For example these two dummy examples are identical:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@123.456.78.90

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
    root@123.456.78.90
```

## Summary

You have all the knowledge and tools installed on your local computer to
effectively develop your Shiny app and to interact with remote servers and
online services.

Before we review the different ways of developing and hosting your Shiny app,
we quickly introduce a few example apps. We will use these apps to demonstrate 
the steps for the hosting options.
