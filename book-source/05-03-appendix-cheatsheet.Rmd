# How to Pick the Right Hosting Option {-#appendix-how-to-pick}

The Hosting Data Apps website recently celebrated its [6-months
anniversary](https://hosting.analythium.io/hosting-data-apps-6-months-and-40-posts-later/).
During this time I have written 40 posts, almost all about Shiny hosting
options. Some of these posts reviewed particular hosting options, such
as Shinyapps.io, Shiny Server, Heroku, and ShinyProxy.

A lot has been said about the hosting options themselves, but what about
the needs of the developers and the users?

The most important question to ask is: "*which option is better *for
what**"? This is where developers and the users of the app come into
the picture with their *specific needs and constraints*.

You could say, for example, that "*I want to host my portfolio for free
and I don't care about a custom domain name*". Or a nonprofit might say,
"*we want to host our apps at low cost, we want custom domains, and we
want to be able to handle surge traffic, but we don't want to maintain
any servers*".

These are really specific criteria, and if you ask me, I might say
Shinyapps.io is best for you and Heroku with a Docker-based deployment
is best for this organization. But how would you or I make such a
decision?

If you have been developing Shiny apps, you might already have your
preferred way of deployment. But as your needs evolve, you will identify
additional requirements and might find that your go-to option is not the
best anymore. Then you'll do some research and find the next option.

If you are not yet familiar with Shiny hosting options, you still need
to make an informed choice at some point, so that you are not wasting
your time and effort on something that will not serve you well over the
long run. Here is the 3 step process that you can follow to help you
with this decision.

Before you begin take a piece of paper.

## Start with the Why {-}

*Why do you want the app or apps deployed?* Are you building a
portfolio to boost your career? Are you deploying useful apps for
stakeholders or clients of your organization? Are you trying to sell an
app as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering?

Write down your answer.

Getting clear on the why is the most important question. You might even
realize that *you don't need to host* your Shiny app. For example,
your app might be used on a laptop as a GUI to analyze data by
non-specialists in the field without internet or cell coverage. In this
case, no need to move on to step 2, because all you need is to [run
Shiny locally](https://hosting.analythium.io/run-shiny-apps-locally/).

However, if your answer makes it clear to you that your users will be
accessing the app over the Internet, move on to step 2.

## List Your Requirements {-}

Answering the Why question will probably reveal important details about
your motivations, your audience, the number of apps you are going to
host, etc. The answer will also bring you closer to identifying the
*requirements* that you'll need.

For example, do you need a custom domain, how many users are you
expecting, do you need authentication or app-level authorization? Do you
want to host a single app or do you need to host many apps? Will you
host non-Shiny apps?

Write these down too.

The following table lists the important features for many different
*Shiny hosting options*. The table lists tiers offered by the same
company as a separate option. Use this table to find the options that
meet your requirements. For now, just ignore the columns inside the blue
rectangle.

If you crave a more interactive experience, I made a filterable version:

View the video of it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGKQMKuz-ww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGKQMKuz-ww).

Visit [https://hosting.analythium.io/assets/files/shiny-hosting-options.html](https://hosting.analythium.io/assets/files/shiny-hosting-options.html) to filter the options and pick the right hosting option for your Shiny app.

Once you filter the table according to your requirements, you'll see a
list of your *ideal hosting options*. Put these in the file or onto
the paper too.

## Identify Your Constraints {-}

The last step involves identifying your *constraints*:

-   What is your *budget*?
-   What is your current *skill level*?
-   How much time do you have *time*?

Recognizing these constraints will guide you toward an *optimal
solution*. This is the point where the columns inside the blue
rectangle come in.

The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) (USD/year) covers licensing fees and
operating costs for the "Number of Apps" listed in the table. Prices
range quite a bit from free to the tens of thousands. Price increases
with performance and with the availability of enterprise features, such
as custom domains and authentication.

*PaaS* means platform-as-a-service, i.e. it is a fully managed system
without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This
also means less control over the infrastructure, i.e. when it comes to
choosing the *data region* where your app is served from.

*Unlimited app hours* are more common for self-hosted options or paid
PaaS plans including a single app. The need to host *multiple apps*
will involve some compromises. The ability to host *non-Shiny apps*
(Dahs, Streamlit, etc.) is a feature for RStudio Connect and the
Docker-based options ([Shinyapps and Shiny Server can host Shiny for
Python](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/docs/deploy.html)).

*Time* as a constraint will depend on how far your current skill level
is from the level needed for a specific hosting option. You also have to
consider that some options are fully managed PaaS offerings, others you
have to manage, or learn how to use Docker.

If you have to develop *new skills*, it might take longer. If you have
to manage your servers, it will take more time to get started and then
you are on the hook for maintaining your setup.

Make your selections inside the columns within the blue area.

## Options at a glance {-}

After the 3-step process, you should see only a few or a single option
left. Click on the name of the hosting option and the link will take you
to the relevant tag page on the Hosting Data Apps website:

-   Follow the instructions in the *tutorials* to get started
-   At the end of each post, you'll find a *Further reading* section
    listing *additional resources*

If there is no option left in the table, then you might need to be more
realistic about your expectations or relax some of your constraints. For
example, to keep costs low, you could spend more time and invest in
skill development. But if you have more room in your budget, you might
choose a different path. You can also revise your requirements until you
find an acceptable solution.


The following diagram gives an intuitive overview of the different
options. The vertical axis represents the *total cost* from the table
above: free, low, and high cost. The horizontal axis shows a *range of
skills* you need to [set up and manage your hosting
solution](https://hosting.analythium.io/the-taxonomy-of-shiny-hosting-options/).
It can be as simple as pushing a button, or as complex as managing
servers or cloud clusters.

The hosting options in this diagram are not separated by tiers but
rather shown as spanning over a range. The fill colours identify Docker
and non-Docker-based options, the stroke styling indicates the PaaS
solutions.

Starting November 28, 2022, free Heroku Dynos, free Heroku Postgres, and
free Heroku Data for Redis will no longer be available -- see [this
